# Python - Minimal Template Guide

This guide introduces a basic template for Python projects, designed to help you get started quickly and efficiently. It includes a straightforward project structure, pre-configured logging, and task management tools. Essential libraries are already included, so you can focus on your project without worrying about initial setup.

ðŸ‘‰ You can explore additional templates through our tools or on our [Portal](https://robocorp.com/portal/tag/template).

## Overview
This template uses the [Python framework](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp) and related [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/blob/master/docs/README.md#python-libraries) to provide a reliable foundation for your project.

## How to Run the Project

### Using VS Code
1. Install the [Robocorp Code extension](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features).
2. Use the side panel and command palette for running, debugging, and accessing code completion and documentation.

### Using the Command Line
1. Download [RCC](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).
2. Run the command: `rcc run`.

## Results

ðŸš€ After running, check the `log.html` file located in the `output` folder.

## Managing Dependencies

We recommend adding your project dependencies to the [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) file. This helps manage the Python environment and ensures consistency across different machines.

<details>
  <summary>Why use conda.yaml?</summary>

Think of `conda.yaml` as an improved version of `requirements.txt`. It manages not only your Python packages but also the entire Python environment. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s better:

- Ensures your project runs seamlessly on other machines.
- Avoids issues with Python installations across devices.
- Lets you specify the exact Python and pip versions, preventing dependency conflicts.
- Removes the need for additional tools like `venv` or `pyenv`.
- Provides access to [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge), simplifying dependency management.
